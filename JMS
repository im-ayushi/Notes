The term JMS stands for Java Message Service, a Java API which acts as a interface between applications to create, send, receive and read messages between them.

It is an asynchronous system, which delivers the messages to a client as they arrive and it does not have to request to receive a message. When the messages are available, they will reach to the client automatically.

The Java Messaging Service is an API used in J2EE technology for exchanging information between two separate and independent network entities (group of hosts).
